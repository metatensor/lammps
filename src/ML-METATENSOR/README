The ML-METATENSOR package provides the metatensor pair style, which allow to use
arbitrary machine learning models with LAMMPS.


The easiest way to build and install this code is with CMake, by configuring
LAMMPS with `cmake -DPKG_ML-METATENSOR=ON`. This will download and build
metatensor-torch for you. You still need to provide an installation of the C++
libtorch. The easiest way to do this is to install one with pip/conda, and then pass
`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(python -c "import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)")`
to cmake during configuration.


TODO: build without CMake
