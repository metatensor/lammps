The ML-METATENSOR package provides the metatensor pair style, which allow to use
arbitrary machine learning models with LAMMPS.


The easiest way to build and install this code is with CMake. You'll need to
fist install libtorch, either by installing PyTorch itself with Python, or by
downloading the prebuilt C++ library from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

```bash
# point this to the path where you extracted the C++ libtorch
TORCH_PREFIX=../../..
# if you used Python to install torch, you can do this:
TORCH_PREFIX=$(python -c "import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)")

# get the code for this branch
git clone https://github.com/luthaf/LAMMPS --branch ml-metatensor --depth=1
cd LAMMPS
mkdir build
cd build

# patch a bug from torch's MKL detection
./../src/ML-METATENSOR/patch-torch.sh "$TORCH_PREFIX"

# configure cmake
cmake -DPKG_ML-METATENSOR=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$TORCH_PREFIX" ../cmake

# optional: enable other packages you need
ccmake .

# compile
cmake --build . --parallel 10

# optional: install the result of the compilation
cmake --build . --target install
```
