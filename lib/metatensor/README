# ML-METATENSOR

The files in this directory are helpers to install all the dependencies of the
ML-METATENSOR package:

- the C++ version of libtorch;
- the core metatensor library;
- the metatensor_torch library;

You can type "make lib-metatensor" from the src directory to see help on how to
download and build this library via make commands, or you can do the same thing
by typing "python Install.py" from within this directory. There are many options
you can set to choose where to install the libraries and whether to download
pre-built versions or compile your own.

Alternatively, you can download and build the above dependencies (see
https://docs.metatensor.org/latest/installation.html for information on how to
do this) somewhere on your system; and then make a copy of
`Makefile.lammps.empty` named `Makefile.lammps`, and edit it to add the right
flags for your compiler. You'll need to add the three libraries above to the
include search path, library search path; and you'll need to link LAMMPS with
the `torch`, `c10`, (optionally `torch_cuda` and `c10_cuda` for GPU support),
`metatensor` and `metatensor_torch` libraries.
